<h1>1. Editing MIDI Notes and Velocities </h1>

<p> One of my favourite aspects of MIDI editing is changing the velocities of the notes. This can help make your synths sound more interesting, or your drums sound more realistic.</p>

<p> You can also turn off the grid to get some crazy offbeat rhythms, or make instruments sound more lifelike by taking human imperfection into account. </p>

<h1>2. Haas effect with Simple Delay </h1>

<p> The Haas effect is a psychoacoustic phenomenon discovered by Dr. Helmut Haas in 1949. When one sound is followed by another by a delay time of approx. 40 ms or less, listeners perceive it as a single sound. It results in the stereo image of a sound being made wider. We can recreate this effect using Ableton's Simple Delay effect: </p>

<p> We can increase the effect by decreasing or increasing the Dry/Wet knob. For some cool results, try automating the Feedback knob. </p>

<h1>3. Customising the Metronome sound </h1>

<p>In Live 10 you can choose from three different Metronome sounds; Classic, Click and Wood. Open the Metronome settings by clicking the pull-down to change the sound:</p>

<p>You can also import your own Metronome sounds by replacing the default sounds.</p>
